# frama-c
## A platform to make your C code safer and more secure

Frama-C is an open-source extensible and collaborative platform dedicated to
source-code analysis of C software.  The Frama-C analyzers assist you in
various source-code-related activities, from navigation through unfamiliar
projects up to certification of critical software.

Frama-C gathers several static and dynamic analysis techniques in a single
collaborative framework.  The collaborative approach of Frama-C allows static
analyzers to build upon the results already computed by other analyzers in the
framework.
